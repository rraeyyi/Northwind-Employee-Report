Umesh Rao & John Rollman & Yi Ren

## Introduction
We used motified version of Northwind SQLite3 database, which originally comes from https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3.

The Northwind sample database was provided with Microsoft Access as a tutorial schema for managing small business customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, and employees. Northwind is an excellent tutorial schema for a small-business ERP, with customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting.
